## **How the app works:**
Users start AI-powered voice debates by clicking the Vapi widget, argue their position with an AI assistant, then their arguments get published to a community forum where others can upvote/downvote and comment on them.

## **Notable features:**
- **AI Voice Debates**: Real-time voice conversations with AI using Vapi
- **Community Forum**: Public argument sharing with voting and comments
- **Live Counter**: Shows how many people want to be "proved wrong"
- **Leaderboard**: Gamified scoring based on upvotes + arguments created
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile tabs, desktop grid layout
- **Real-time Updates**: Live debate counter and community engagement

## **Why did you build this:**
To combat echo chambers and confirmation bias by creating a platform where AI challenges your strongest beliefs, forcing you to defend your ideas and potentially discover you're wrong - turning disagreement into learning.
